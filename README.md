# PB138-Project-cshd

## Technical stuff
Make sure, that you `installed` or `updated` all of your modules in package.json files.
There are two diffrent package.json files in a `backend` and `frontend` directories.
```bash
$¬†cd ./frontend && npm i && cd ../backend && npm i & cd ..
```
## Starting an application
If you work on your `localserver`, you need start up 2 terminals.
On a first teminal **(CLIENT SIDE)**:
```bash
$ cd ./frontend && npm run start
```
On the second terminal **(SERVER SIDE)**:
```bash
$ cd ./backend && npm run start
```

## ƒåesko-Slovensk√° Hern√≠ Dat√°baze (CSHD)

## Adding commits (pushing)
We advise you to make a new branch for every commit you made (trivial files could be exception). This is because maybe 2 people might have worked on the same file and they didn't pull their changes (if some of these two (or more) people pushed the changes).
